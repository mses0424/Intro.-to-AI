# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System
This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition System using deep learning model MobileViT. The system is designed to perform multi-task facial analysis on webcam and image inputs, including:

Facial Expression Classification (7 categories)

Race Classification (5 categories)

Gender Classification (2 categories)

Age Estimation (10 age groups)

The goal is to analyze the impact of model architecture, dataset characteristics, and input modalities (grayscale vs. RGB) on classification accuracy.
