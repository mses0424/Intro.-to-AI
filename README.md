# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System

This project implements a **Facial Expression Recognition System** using the MobileViT deep learning model.  
The system performs **multi-task facial analysis** on webcam and image inputs, including:

- **Facial Expression Classification** (7 categories)
- **Race Classification** (5 categories)
- **Gender Classification** (2 categories)
- **Age Estimation** (10 age groups)

The goal is to analyze the impact of **model architecture**, **dataset characteristics**, and **input modalities** (grayscale vs. RGB) on classification accuracy.
